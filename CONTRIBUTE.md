## Git Convention

### Branch Strategy

- Based on the Git-flow strategy, we operate with main, develop branches, and feature support branches.
- Development is divided into main, develop, and feature branches.

**1. Basic Branch Strategy**

- `main` branch: This branch is used only for stable versions and deployment stages.
- `develop` branch: This branch serves as the master in the git-flow for the development stage. It is divided into `dev-be` and `dev-fe` for backend and frontend management, respectively. This branch is periodically merged into `main`.

**2. Feature Branches**

- Feature branch (`feature/`): Used for an independent development environment for each feature. For example, you can name branches as `feature/fe/login`, `feature/be/login`. When development is complete, merge into `dev-fe` or `dev-be`.
- Use camel case for naming feature branches.
